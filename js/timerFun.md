In the first code snippet:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
setTimeout(() => {
console.log(i);
}, 1000);
}
All the setTimeout functions share the same delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). However, the loop runs synchronously, and by the time the first setTimeout is executed, the loop has already completed, and the value of i is 6. Therefore, when the console.log(i) is executed, it will print 6 for all iterations.

In the second code snippet:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
setTimeout(() => {
console.log(i);
}, i _ 1000);
}
Here, the delay for each setTimeout is dynamically calculated based on the current value of i. The first setTimeout will have a delay of 1 second (1 _ 1000), the second will have a delay of 2 seconds (2 \* 1000), and so on. This ensures that each console.log(i) is executed after a different delay.

As a result, you'll see the numbers 1 through 5 printed to the console with increasing delays, reflecting the values of i at the time each setTimeout was scheduled. This is often used in scenarios where you want to create a delayed execution for each iteration of a loop.
